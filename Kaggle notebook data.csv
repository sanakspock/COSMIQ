But what is it?First, a bit of background infoDNA is composed of nucleotides, or chemical building blocks. Nucleotides include adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). Talk about a flashback to biology! Nucleosides are formed from these nucleotides.The science behind Sodium DNA is based on an ingredient called Polydeoxyribonucleotide or PDRN.So - what is PDRN?PDRN are DNA fragments mainly extracted from the sperm cells oftrout or salmon. Meaning, PDRN can be derived from Sodium DNA.PDRN consists of chains of nucleotides and nucleosides mentioned above. They can range anywhere from 80 - 2000 pairs.Studies show PDRN has the following properties:anti-inflammatoryanti-melanogenetic / reduces hyperpigmentationwound healingangiogenesis (the formation of new blood vessels)collagen synthesissoft tissue regenerationWrapping upFurther studies are needed to truly confirm this ingredients anti-aging ability (Remember, retinol has decades of research!).When using this ingredient, is is best to ask a brand about the source of their Sodium DNA. You'll want to find products where the Sodium DNA is sourced from fish. Some Sodium DNA is derived from calf / cow thymus.""]","['https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-71095-0_9534', 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29082254/', 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/19/6/296', 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74004-0', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7585621/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8618295/', 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2096691122000723#sec9']"

It is a broad-spectrum sunscreen ingredient, meaning it can protect the skin against UVB and short UVA rays. The absorption range is 270-350 nm with peak absorption at 288 and 350 nm.This chemical ingredient protects your skin by using chemical reactions to convert UV rays into heat and energy. UV absorbers may absorb both UVA and UVB rays. It is often combined with other sunscreen ingredients to help with stability.Ongoing research is looking into whether oxybenzone causes skin irritation and sensitivity. However, it has been shown to trigger contact dermatitis in some studies.Oxybenzone is allowed in certain concentrations by many countries. It is allowed up to 6% in the US, and Canada, 5% in Japan, and 10% in Australia. Other countries and regions of the US have banned this ingredient to protect coral reefs and marine ecosystems. These places include Hawaii, Key West, US Virgin Islands, marine parks in Thailand, Aruba, and Palau.The EU currently allows the following maximum concentrations:6% in face, hand, and lip products2.2% in body, propellant, and pump spray products0.5% in other productsStudies show conflicting results about oxybenzone being absorbed into the human body.

This plant is native to East Asia and known as ""Tsubaki"" in Japanese.Tsubaki flowers possess antioxidant and soothing properties. This flower has shown to be effective at fighting pollution damage by protecting your skin\'s fibroblasts. Your skin\'s fibroblasts help create collagen and collagen is responsible for youthful, plump skin.This flower also contains many antioxidant enzymes. Antioxidants help fight free-radical molecules. Free-radical molecules are capable of damaging our cells and other genetic material. They may originate from sunlight, air pollution, or cigarette smoke. These free-radical molecules are unstable and are often looking for missing electrons. This instability causes free-radicals to damage our cells. Antioxidants help stabilize free-radicals by donating extra electrons.Thus, Camellia Japonica Flower Extract may help reduce the signs of aging.']","['https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6350298/', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9040028/']"
